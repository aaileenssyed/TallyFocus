# Prioritization Matrix Web App

## Project Overview
This is a lightweight, simple web app built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to prioritize a list of tasks using a pairwise comparison matrix, inspired by the Archer & Olive Prioritization Matrix method.

## Features
- Enter up to 10 tasks to prioritize.
- Interactive matrix to compare each task against others.
- Clickable cells to select which task is more important in each pair.
- Automatic tally and ranking of tasks based on user selections.
- Simple and fast, no dependencies or build setup required.
- Runs directly in any modern web browser.

## How to Use
1. Open the  in your web browser.
2. Enter between 2 and 10 tasks in the input fields.
3. Click "Start Prioritizing" to generate the comparison matrix.
4. Click on each cell marked with `?` to select which task wins the comparison.
5. Watch the results update in real time below the matrix with your prioritized task list.

## Limitations
- Does not currently handle complex tie-breaking beyond visual comparison.
- No persistent storage: refreshing the page clears data.
- Basic styling for simplicity; can be enhanced with custom CSS.

## Installation
No installation necessary! Just open the HTML file in a modern browser or host it on any static web server.

## Future Improvements
- Add localStorage to save progress.
- Improve visual styling and responsiveness.
- Export prioritized list as CSV or PDF.
- Add support for larger task lists or additional priority metrics.

## License
This project is open source and free to use without restrictions.
